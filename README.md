Herein lies the notebooks that I learned from the Udacity Course 'Secure and Private AI', of which I was a part of the scholarship too.

Basic content I learned in the course and the rest of the stuff I learned later. This notebook is highly updated from when I did the course. Used densenet121 and resnet34 and got around 94-95% accuracy using both. Hustled a lot for showing the images and denormalizing them.
